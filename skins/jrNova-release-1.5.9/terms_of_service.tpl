                binding acceptance of these Terms, including any changes or modifications

                <br><br>

                If you believe that material you own has been copied and made accessible in a manner that

                <h3>Third party sites and content</h3>
                <br><br>

                This Service contains links to other Internet sites that our business partners and other
                third parties own or operate. Your use of each of those sites is subject to the terms and conditions,
                if any, that each of those sites have posted. We have no control over third party sites and we are
                not responsible for any changes to or content on them. Our inclusion of any material in the Service's
                search database or a link on our sites is not an endorsement of that material or link or the companies
                that own or operate the material or linked sites.

                <br><br>
                <h3>Your conduct on the Service</h3>
                <br><br>

                In addition to our Site, certain material that you submit may, in our sole discretion, also become
                available to certain partners around the world. If we discover that you have manipulated the data or
                statistics for certain materials, we reserve the right to remove the product from our site and any of
                our Affiliates.  The content on the Service is intended for your personal, noncommercial use. All
                materials published on the Service, including, but not limited to, photographs, graphics, images,
                illustrations, sound clips and flash animation are protected by copyright. You may not modify, publish,
                transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce, create new works from, distribute, perform
                display or in any way exploit any of the materials or content or the service in whole or part.

                If the Service contains bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities and/or
                message or communication facilities (collectively, the "Forums"), you agree to use any Forum only to send
                and receive messages and material that are proper and related to that particular Forum. Without limiting
                the foregoing, you agree that you will not (i) defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise
                violate the legal right of others; (ii) publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate any inappropriate,
                profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful topic, name, material or information;
                (iii) upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that
                may damage the operation of another person's computer; (iv) advertise or offer to sell any goods or
                services for any commercial purpose; (v) conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes or chain
                letters; (vi) download any file posted by another user of a forum that you know or reasonably should know,
                cannot be legally distributed in such matter, (vii) falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or
                other proper notices or proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or other
                material contained in a file that is uploaded; or (viii) restrict or inhibit any other user from using
                and enjoying the forum. We reserve the right to terminate your access to any or all of the forums at any
                time without notice for any reason whatsoever. If, in our sole discretion, you choose a username that is
                obscene, indecent, abusive or which might otherwise subject our site to public disparagement or scorn, we
                reserve the right, without prior notice to you, to automatically change your username, delete your posts
                from the Forums, deny you access to the Forums, or any combination of these options. If you continue to
                choose usernames that we find objectionable, we reserve the right to permanently terminate your access to
                the Forums, the Service or both.

                You will not use the Service for illegal purposes. Use of the Service is subject to existing laws and
                legal process, and nothing contained herein shall limit our right to comply with governmental, court and
                law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Service or information provided to
                or gathered by us with respect to such use.

                <h3>Legal Policies and Notices</h3>
                <br><br>

                You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Service, and all of our officers, directors, owners,
                agents, information providers, affiliates and licensors (collectively, the "Parties") harmless from and
                against any and all liability, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by any
                Party in connection with any claim arising out of (1) any use or alleged use of your account or password
                by any person, whether or not authorized by you, (2) any claim arising out of the material that you submit
                to the Service, including, but not limited to, claims for defamation, violation of rights of publicity
                and/or privacy, copyright infringement, trademark infringement and any claim or liability relating to the
                content, quality, or performance of materials that you submit to the Service. We reserve the right, at our
                own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification
                by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.

                The listing, or absence of listing, of any document in the Service's search database does not imply any
                warranty or guarantee by us, for any companies, products, or services described in such documents. We
                disclaim any and all responsibility or liability for the accuracy, content, completeness, legality,
                reliability, or operability or availability of information or material displayed in the Service's search
                results. We disclaim any responsibility for the deletion, failure to store, mis-delivery, or untimely delivery
                of any information or material. We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from downloading or
                accessing any information or material on the World Wide Web or Internet using search results from the Service.

                WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY
                AS TO THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE CONTENT. THE SERVICE AND THE CONTENT ARE
                DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICE
                IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY POTENTIAL DAMAGES TO YOUR
                COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES
                OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES
                OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, ANY CONTENT OR ANY PRODUCTS
                OR SERVICES SOLD THROUGH THE SERVICE. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOU WILL ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
                AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE AND THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ITS CONTENT.
                WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
                USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.

                Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our sites will be settled by binding
                arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.
                Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in
                any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration shall be conducted in
                San Francisco, California, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
                jurisdiction thereof. Either you or we may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent
                jurisdiction in San Francisco, California necessary to protect the rights or property of you or the Party
                (or its agents, suppliers, and subcontractors) pending the completion of arbitration.

                These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Parties with respect to the Service, and
                supersedes all previous written or oral agreements. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid
                or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
                superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision
                and the remainder of the Terms shall continue in effect. Some states do not allow exclusion of implied warranties
                or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may
                not apply to you. In such states, our liability and that of our third party content providers and their
                respective agents shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
