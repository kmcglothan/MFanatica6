Thank you for your purchase!

Your purchase is currently "pending" in PayPal, which typically means the payment was sent as an "eCheck".

An eCheck typically takes from 5 to 7 days to clear - once it clears you will receive an email letting you know the item has been added to your Downloads section.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks again!
