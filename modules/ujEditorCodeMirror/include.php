	In form_editor.tpl or its skin override jrCore_form_editor.tpl add the following:

    codemirror: {
    	path: '{$_conf.jrCore_base_url}/modules/ujEditorCodeMirror/contrib/codemirror/'
    },

    And replace the word "code" in both plugins: and toolbar: with the following:

    {if $ujeditorcodemirror}ujeditorcodemirror{else}code{/if}

    The ujEditorCodeMirror module uses its own instance of CodeMirror as it requires the latest version.

    It implements the TinyMCE plugin by Arjan Haverkamp
