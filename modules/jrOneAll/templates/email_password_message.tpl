Thank you for creating your account!

You created your account by linking up with {$provider}, so we've created you a new temporary password that you can use to log into the system without relying on {$provider} (although you can always
log in using {$provider} too):

user: {$user_name}
pass: {$user_pass}

Please change your password as soon as you can:

{$user_account_url}

We look forward to seeing you online!
